ANGEL, SONG

 A golden-skinned woman sings a sublime melody that cascades over the charging soldiers. As she sings, music notes etch themselves onto her skin.

 KIND, YET DISCERNING. Song angels are archetypal altruists, delivering unprovoked acts of kindness upon people in need. When a song angel interacts with mortal nobility, it prefers to take an unassuming form such as a dirty urchin or crone to test its charges

 integrity. If spurned by a callous or haughty individual, the song

 angel unveils its true, radiant splendor.

 KEEPERS OF MUSIC. When a song angel plays or sings a verse, the notes it performed appear on its body. If the angel is destroyed, all the music it ever created rings out in glorious harmony, its heavenly elegy audible for miles.

 LEAD THROUGH INSPIRATION. While a song angel's mission is to comfort and safeguard its mortal charges, it is meant to lead, not to serve. These angels often command soldiers on the front line, inspiring all those

 who hear its songs. IMMORTAL NATURE. The song angel doesn't require

 food, drink, or sleep.
